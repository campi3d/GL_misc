Missing things in API

- selected() signal for nodes. Should be emited whenever a selection is made and return the selected node

- Ever since the context sensitive shortcut system was introduced none of the mari.actions method cover them.
  For example you might set a shortcut for an action in context Nodegraph.
  But when you then query the action with action.shortcuts() you do not receive the shortcut that is set. Just an empty list.
  Ideally it should work this way:
  - be able to set a shortcut for a context or for global
  - shortcut in use should tell you which context it is in etc.
  
- there is nothing exposed to figure out what node is connected to a nodes output !
